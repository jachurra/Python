Advanced Python Scripts for Amazon Web Services (AWS)
These scripts are intended for engineers that support AWS accounts and require at a minimum prior coding experience.
Although there are many ways to manage AWS either via the CLI or API, the scripts I have created show a variety of working methods.
You will need to adjust the scripts to your environment, to do so you should be familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
